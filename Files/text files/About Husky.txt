Siberian Husky
The unique wolf-like looks of this beautiful breed make the husky a very popular pet. There are different kinds of huskies, but most often they will be either black or grey, and sometimes red. Huskies often have sky blue eyes.

This breed is commonly used for sledding, whereby several dogs pull a sled to ease the travel in cold areas covered with snow. Of course, huskies can be kept as pets in places that are not so cold, although it is recommended to still keep them very active.

Because they are very curious, they can be taken on longer hiking trips. Even though they are quite big, these dogs are friendly and perfect for young children.
